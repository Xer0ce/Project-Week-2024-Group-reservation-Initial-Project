# Project Week 2024 | Group Reservation | Initial Project

Welcome to this repository dedicated to the development of new features for the French Blood Establishment (EFS) application. This work is carried out as part of the Ionis Project Week 2024. We are proud to present our initial concept, despite it being adopted by another group selected for the semi-finals.

## New Features

### Quiz on Blood Donation Prejudices
We have developed an interactive quiz, inspired by the Kahoot format, aimed at raising awareness and informing users about common prejudices related to blood donation. This quiz is designed to be both educational and engaging.

### Group Reservation for Blood Donation
This innovative feature (which inspired another group) allows users to book blood donation sessions as a group. With this function, you can invite friends to join your donation session. Invited users will receive a notification encouraging them to accompany you, thus promoting group blood donation.

We hope that these new features will significantly contribute to the user experience of the EFS application and encourage more people to participate in blood donation.
